## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow responsible disclosure:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email us directly** at: [security@yourdomain.com] (replace with your email)
3. **Include detailed information**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll respond within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Updates**: Regular updates on investigation progress
- **Resolution**: Fix timeline depends on severity
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is deployed

### Response Timeline

| Severity | Response Time | Fix Timeline |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Critical | 24 hours | 7 days |
| High | 48 hours | 14 days |
| Medium | 5 days | 30 days |
| Low | 7 days | 60 days |

## üîß Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Input Validation
```typescript
// Always validate user input
import { z } from 'zod'

const sessionSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1).max(100),
  description: z.string().max(500).optional(),
  isPublic: z.boolean()
})

// Use the schema to validate
const validatedData = sessionSchema.parse(userInput)
```

#### File Upload Security
```typescript
// Validate file types and sizes
const allowedTypes = ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.pdf']
const maxSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024 // 10MB

if (!allowedTypes.includes(fileExtension)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid file type')
}

if (fileSize > maxSize) {
  throw new Error('File too large')
}
```

#### Database Security
```typescript
// Use Prisma parameterized queries (automatic protection)
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: userId }, // Safe from SQL injection
  select: { id: true, name: true } // Only select needed fields
})
```

### For Administrators

#### Environment Security
```bash
# Use strong secrets
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Use environment-specific URLs
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://yourdomain.com"  # Production
# NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # Development only

# Secure database connections
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/db?sslmode=require"
```

#### File System Security
```bash
# Set proper permissions for uploads
chmod 755 uploads/
chown www-data:www-data uploads/

# Regular cleanup of temporary files
find uploads/ -type f -mtime +30 -delete
```

### For Deployments

#### HTTPS Configuration
- **Always use HTTPS** in production
- **Configure secure headers**
- **Use proper SSL certificates**
- **Enable HSTS** (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

#### Database Security
- **Use SSL connections** for database
- **Regular database backups**
- **Principle of least privilege** for database users
- **Network isolation** for database servers

#### Server Security
- **Keep systems updated**
- **Use firewalls** to restrict access
- **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
- **Regular security audits**

## üîç Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS configured and tested
- [ ] Database connections use SSL
- [ ] File upload restrictions in place
- [ ] Authentication flows tested
- [ ] Input validation on all forms
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Monitoring and logging in place
- [ ] Regular backup schedule established
- [ ] Access controls reviewed
- [ ] Incident response plan documented

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Monthly dependency updates
- [ ] Quarterly security reviews
- [ ] Regular penetration testing

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### File Uploads
- **Risk**: Malicious file uploads
- **Mitigation**: File type validation, size limits, virus scanning
- **Monitoring**: Track unusual upload patterns

### Session Management
- **Risk**: Session hijacking
- **Mitigation**: Secure session tokens, HTTPS, session timeout
- **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual session activity

### Database Access
- **Risk**: Unauthorized data access
- **Mitigation**: Role-based access, encrypted connections
- **Monitoring**: Database query logging
